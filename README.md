# TopCityPopv2
Top 5 City Pop song player app

This app was designed as an exercise in using the Youtube API in Android Studio.

I wanted to make an app that would play my top 5 Japanese city pop videos from youtube but play on the app rather than simply linking to youtube via the phone's browser.
This particular version of the app stems from an earlier version that only linked to the Youtube. That app was also written in Java as I was beginning to learn Android development.

By the time I was ready to work on integrating the Youtube player in the app, I had already learned Kotlin, but figured it would take too much time to convert the project so I decided to reinforce my Java skills by finishing this project in Java.
