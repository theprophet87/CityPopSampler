# Top City Pop Sampler App
This is an app which acts as a sampler of Japanese City Pop music via Youtube videos.

## How It's Made:
I used Kotlin in Android Studio to make this app. The original version of this app was built using Java, but I decided to rebuild the whole app using Kotlin as I decided to pivot my focus on that language.


## Lessons Learned:
This app taught me how to use fragments and tabs to navigate, as well as implementing the Drawer Layout for a menu. Furthermore, this was my introduction to using a Youtube player and making RecyclerView items clickable. 



## Things to improve:
I'd like to make the RecyclerView items movable to re-order the videos.
